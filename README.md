# Langchain-applications

LangChain Applications
A curated set of LangChain-based prototypes leveraging the power of generative AI and advanced query tools (e.g., Groq). Ideal for exploring integrations and showcasing LLM-powered workflows.

Contents
1-Langchain/ — Sample LangChain implementations such as chaining models, prompt workflows, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

2-Groq/ — Proof-of-concept applications that integrate Groq-style query logic or vector-based search capabilities.

.env — Configuration placeholder for managing environment variables like API keys and model endpoints.

requirements.txt — Lists dependencies essential for running the projects.

README.md — (This file) Guide for developers to understand, run, and extend the applications.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

API access credentials (e.g., OpenAI key), configured in .env

Virtual environment (recommended) for dependency isolation
