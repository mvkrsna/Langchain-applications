# LangChain Applications

A curated set of **LangChain-based prototypes** leveraging the power of **generative AI** and advanced query tools (e.g., **Groq**).  
Ideal for exploring integrations and showcasing **LLM-powered workflows**.

---

## 📂 Contents

- **`1-Langchain/`** — Sample LangChain implementations such as chaining models, prompt workflows, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **`2-Groq/`** — Proof-of-concept applications that integrate Groq-style query logic or vector-based search capabilities.
- **`.env`** — Configuration placeholder for managing environment variables like API keys and model endpoints.
- **`requirements.txt`** — Lists dependencies essential for running the projects.
- **`README.md`** — (This file) Guide for developers to understand, run, and extend the applications.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **API access credentials** (e.g., OpenAI API key) configured in `.env`
- **Virtual environment** (recommended) for dependency isolation

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mvkrsna/Langchain-applications.git
cd Langchain-applications

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env        # Then edit .env with your credentials


## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The repository follows a **modular architecture** to keep experiments and prototypes well-organized.

```bash
Langchain-applications/
│
├── 1-Langchain/         # LangChain core examples: prompts, chains, RAG, and integrations
│   ├── <script1>.py
│   ├── <script2>.py
│   └── ...

├── 2-Groq/              # Groq-based prototypes: high-performance queries and vector DB search

## 📜 Key Principles

- **Modularity** — Each folder focuses on a distinct use-case or integration.
- **Configuration isolation** — `.env` file keeps API keys and environment-specific details separate from the codebase.
- **Extensibility** — Easy to add new LLM providers, vector stores, or chains without affecting existing modules.
- **Reusability** — Common functions and helpers can be moved to shared modules for cross-project use.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **LangChain Agents** — Introduce agent-based architectures for multi-tool orchestration.
- **LangGraph Integration** — Build complex, graph-based reasoning workflows.
- **Observability & Tracing** — Add LangSmith or similar tools for performance monitoring and debugging.
- **Unit Testing** — Implement automated tests for each module to ensure stability during enhancements.
- **Docker Support** — Add Dockerfile for easy deployment in containerized environments.
- **Cloud Deployment** — Deploy as Streamlit apps or FastAPI services for public demos.
- **Advanced RAG** — Enhance retrieval-augmented generation with hybrid search and reranking.
- **Multi-Model Support** — Seamlessly switch between OpenAI, Hugging Face, Anthropic, and Groq.

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure all required API keys are set in the `.env` file before running any scripts.
- Explore individual folders for specific examples and additional usage instructions.
- **Contributions are welcome** — feel free to submit PRs with new use cases or improvements!
